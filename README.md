# Dento-Web-Programming-Final-Project

Project Description: Dento is modest system thats I decided to practice with for Web Programming course (II Software Engineering Student). 
                     From the technical part it has the main generalities that a system should be based on, from the viewers side, it is 
                     as well 'readable' and has a simple UI/UX design. 
                   
Installation:        At this point that I have uploaded this project, it has much more to be worked on. The only dependency is having a PC 
                     and some internet to have a look at the files. 
                  
Usage:               The project is based in a simple system, where you can find login, signup, leaving an appointment, having displayed
                     general information and facing with a easy-lookig-at design. You can navigate through the sections, 'travel' around the
                     implementation and so on. It does not have a database, which is yet to be done. But due to some technincal issues, myphpadmin
                     might have not really been in the mood lately. Since we got to do the presentation of the project, I will be handling it with
                     what I have achieved to code by now and find through internet, regarding inspirational website templates, or solutions as well. 
                     
Features:            The Sign Up section which allowes you to  register to receive promotions and updates from the clinic, never missing out on exclusive offers. (Economic)
                     Appointment Bookingwhere you can easily schedule your dental appointments online, choose the date and time that you want. (Accessability)
                     Invoice Download: Download and print your invoices for hassle-free payment and record-keeping. (I really like the booking process)
                     
Technologies Used:  Frontend : HTML , CSS, JS
                    Backend: PHP, JS, MYSQL(which I could not connect but to be continued...)

Contributions:      This project was a great opportunity for me to learn PHP and MySQL and explore Frontend. Although I'm still new to these technologies, 
                    I'm excited to continue improving my skills and exploring more advanced features. 
                    I look forward to expanding this project in the future and adding it to my portfolio!
